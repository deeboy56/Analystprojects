This repository contains a basic data anlysis project based on data of a supermarket chain and it's sales.
I intially took the data from kaggle and filtered it using my sql scripts.
The sql scripts include tthe filtering code I used I then exported it as csv and visulaised in power Bi.
The script and csv files used are attatched, including the power bi visulisations as screenshots and the power Bi document.
